## Competition Participation

Some of the first questions that might come to mind are those regarding participation
in each level of competition (i.e. District, Region, and State) and conference classification.

It seems fair to say that the distribution of schools among Districts, Regions, and Conferences
is relatively even. [^state_grouping] [^competition_groupings] This is to be expected since the UIL presumably
tries to divide schools evenly among each grouping (to the extent possible) in
order to stimulate fair competition.

[^state_grouping]:
The State competition level is not shown because it there is no "sub-groupings" of State
(like there is 1, 2, 3, ... for each of the groupings shown).

[^competition_groupings]:
As a technical note, Districts, Regions, and Conferences are not really all of the same "type"
of data. Nevertheless, these different "groupings" each stratify the sample population in some manner.

Going along with curiosity about participation at each competition level and conference
is the question of the number of distinct individual competitors and schools for each
competition type (i.e. Calculator, Computer Science, etc.)

Science stands out when evaluating participation by competition type alone.

But what about when considering 
competition level (i.e. District, Region, and State) as well?

```{r summ_n_bycompcomplvl, include = FALSE}
summ_n_bycompcomplvl <-
  bind_rows(
    schools %>%
      summarise_n_bycompcomplvl() %>%
      mutate(entity = "Schools"),
    persons %>%
      summarise_n_bycompcomplvl() %>%
      mutate(entity = "Competitors")
  ) %>%
  mutate(complvl_entity = paste(complvl, entity, sep = ", "))
```


```{r viz_n_bycompcomplvl}
viz_n_bycompcomplvl <-
  summ_n_bycompcomplvl %>%
  visualize_n_bycomp_common_at(col_grp = "complvl_entity") +
  facet_wrap( ~ complvl_entity, scales = "free", ncol = 2) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  labs(
    title = "Count of Entities for Each Competition Type and Level",
    subtitle = NULL
  )
viz_n_bycompcomplvl

teproj::export_ext_png(
  viz_n_bycompcomplvl,
  export = params$export_viz,
  dir = params$dir_viz,
  units = "in",
  height = 8,
  width = 8
)
```

Science seems to prevail again.

Now, what about when also considering conferences?

```{r summ_n_bycompcomplvlconf, include = FALSE}
summ_n_bycompcomplvlconf <-
  bind_rows(
    schools %>%
      summarise_n_bycompcomplvlconf() %>%
      mutate(entity = "Schools"),
    persons %>%
      summarise_n_bycompcomplvlconf() %>%
      mutate(entity = "Competitors")
  ) %>%
  mutate(complvl_comp = paste(complvl, comp, sep = ", "))
summ_n_bycompcomplvlconf
```

```{r viz_n_bycompcomplvlconf, include = FALSE, fig.show = "asis"}
viz_n_bycompcomplvlconf <-
  summ_n_bycompcomplvlconf %>%
  filter(entity == "Competitors") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(conf), funs(factor)) %>%
  visualize_n_bycomp_common_at(x = "conf", col_grp = "complvl_comp") +
  facet_grid(complvl ~ comp, scales = "free", labeller = label_wrap_gen(width = 12)) +
  labs(
    title = "Count of Competition for Each Competition Type,\nLevel, and Conference",
    subtitle = NULL,
    x = "Conference"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
viz_n_bycompcomplvlconf

teproj::export_ext_png(
  viz_n_bycompcomplvlconf,
  export = params$export_viz,
  dir = params$dir_viz,
  units = "in",
  height = 8,
  width = 8
)
```

Once again, all hail Science! Science appears to be the answer to the numerous
variations of the "Which competition type/level has the most ...?" question.

### Competition Scores

That's enough about the volume of individuals and schools in each competition.
What about their scores?

```{r persons_stats_bycomp, include = FALSE}
persons_stats_bycomp <-
  persons %>%
  summarise_stats_score_by_at(cols_grp = "comp")
persons_stats_bycomp
```

```{r viz_persons_stats_bycomp, include = FALSE, fig.show = "asis"}
n_comps <- length(params$comps)
q05_min <- min(persons_stats_bycomp$q05)
q95_max <- max(persons_stats_bycomp$q95)

lab_title_stats_bycomp_prefix <-
  "Distribution of Scores for Each Competition Type"
lab_caption_stats_bycomp <-
  "Dashed line: mean. Solid lines: z-score = -1 and 1."

viz_persons_stats_bycomp <-
  persons %>%
  inner_join(persons_stats_bycomp, by = "comp") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = score)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = comp), bins = 30) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_fill_set1() +
  geom_vline(
    aes(xintercept = mean),
    color = "black",
    linetype = "solid",
    size = 1
  ) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = z_n1), color = "black", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = z_p1), color = "black", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(q05_min, q95_max)) +
  # scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(), labels = scales::comma) +
  teplot::scale_y_pretty_comma() +
  # scale_y_continuous(breaks = function(x) round(x, 2)) +
  facet_wrap(
    ~ comp,
    scales = "free",
    nrow = n_comps,
    labeller = label_wrap_gen(width = 12),
    strip.position = "right"
  ) +
  teplot::labs_xy_null() +
  labs(title = lab_title_stats_bycomp_prefix,
       caption = lab_caption_stats_bycomp) +
  teplot::theme_te_facet() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
viz_persons_stats_bycomp

teproj::export_ext_png(
  viz_persons_stats_bycomp,
  export = params$export_viz,
  dir = params$dir_viz,
  units = "in",
  height = 10,
  width = 8
)
```

Take what you will from the above visual, but it is interesting to see which
competition types have wider distributions. This could imply a number of different things:

+ A competition type with a wider distribution (relative to the others) may
be more likely to attract "newbies".

+ Or, such a distribution may simply be headed by "experts".

+ Or, perhaps, it might simply imply that the test was not well made (or "fair"),
resulting in a wide variety of scores. (On the other hand, one might simply
see a right- or left-skewed distribution if the test is not robust.)

To try to understand the score distributions better, let's break them
down by year, competition level, and conference.

```{r persons_stats_bycomp, include = FALSE}

+ It appears from the by-year breakdown that there is no discernible trends among score distributions
across years. The lack of pattern in score distributions
over time is a strong indication that the tests have about the same difficulty every year.
This implies that it would not be unreasonable to compare raw test scores
for a given competition type when comparing individuals
and schools across different years.

+ It is evident from the competition type visual that score range distributions
shift upwards with increasing competition level, as would be expected with
more "superior" competitors advancing to higher levels of competition.

+ From the conference visual, it is apparent that scores generally increase
with increasing conference number, which, itself, corresponds with increasing student body size.
This could be indicative of a number of factors:

    + Larger schools have more "superior" individual competitors, perhaps due
    to having a larger "talent pool" of students.
    + Smaller schools, in an effort to compete in as many different competition types as
    possible and/or reach the minimum number of individual competitors needed to qualify
    the school as a team (e.g. at least 3 individuals), 
    push individuals to participate in competitions types that they would 
    not normally participate even if they are not really prepared to do so.
    (This might be considered a form of [selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias).)
    + There may not be as many schools, and, consequently, as many students, in larger conferences,
    leading to the possibility that the scores in the larger conference are more
    likely to be subject to high variance.
    
    While I somewhat doubt the last of these possibilities (because high variance
    would equally likely manifest in lower scores in larger conferences), the other
    two are intuitive.

So maybe there isn't a some broad, temporal trend to the scores.
But is there a trend in scores among the competition levels (for a given competition type)?
One would think that, assuming that test difficulty is constant
across competition levels, 
there would be an aggregate increase in scores
with increasing competition level (because only the top scoring individuals and schools advance).

In fact, it does appear that score distributions skew higher with higher levels
of competition. If this were not true, then I would suspect that test are made to be
more difficult at each competition stage. (Actually, it might be true that there _is_ some increase
in test difficulty with advancing competitions, but such an adjustment, if it is truly made,
does not quite offset the skill level of the advancing competitors.)

Notably, it appears that Number Sense demonstrates the largest
"jumps" in aggregate scores with increasing competition levels. Having competed
in this competition before, I do not find this all too surprising.
More than any other competition type, those who succeed Number Sense seem to
rely on natural abilities (as opposed to training) to beat out the competition.
I would go so far as to say that for some individuals, this "natural ability" may be "savant-like".
Consequently, with increasing competition level, it is more likely that these
"superior" competitors stand out, and, as observed here, skew
the scoring distributions higher, with "inferior" competitors weighing down the averages.

So there _does_ seem to be a trend of higher scores with higher competition level,
but has _that_ trend changed over time? [^trend]

[^trend]:
Recall that there is no apparent trend when not distinguishing by competition level.

As with the raw scores, there does not appear to be any noticeable
trend in the change in level of difficulty of test between each competition level
over time. (Aside from a steep drop-off in the Science scores in 2014, there's
nothing too interesting about this plot.)
Along with the previous temporal visual where competition level is not distinguished,
this plot is a strong indication that the tests (and, most likely,
the skills of the competitors) have not changed over time.

Such visual inferences are supported quantitatively.
Observe the p.values of the variables for linear regression models fit for each competition type,
where the average year-to-year score difference (as a percentage) is estimated given
average competition-specific score and year. Taking the customary p.value threshhold of 0.05
as the level of significance (where the p.value must be less than the thresshold
in order to infer that the null hypothesis that the model is not predictive), the year term
is shown to be insignificant.

$$
mean \space year \space diff \space pct = intercept + mean * \beta_{1} + year * \beta_{2}
$$

There could be a number of confounding factors that explain the relatively even
competition level of time.

+ It could be that test makers have purposely adjusted the difficulty of tests
to result in scores that are similar to historical scores for a given competition
and/or competition level. (This may be a way to 

+ Or, perhaps more likely, test makers and competition skill level
have stayed relatively the same over time.

If the latter is true, at the very least
we can say that, despite how the media or popular culture may portray younger
generations, the prowess of the academic "elite" of the current generation of high school
students in Texas has not dropped off
(Nonetheless, nothing definitive should be deduced about those 
who do not compete in UIL academic competitions and are anywhere outside of Texas.)

## Conclusion

In this write-up, we visualized the participation and scores of 
academic UIL competitions in a number of different
ways--by competition type, by competition level, by year, and by variations of these.
Next, we'll take a closer look at some more specific questions, focusing on individual competitors.
