# Introduction

See my blog posts (to be linked here)
for the full write-ups, or, check out the `.html` files in the `output/` directory
in this repo, which was used as the basis for the blog post.
The `figs/` directory also contains some of the visualizations in the post.

The documents can be recreated with the following commands:

```{r render, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("R/01-intro.Rmd", output_dir = "output")
rmarkdown::render("R/02-analyze-comps.Rmd", output_dir = "output")
rmarkdown::render("R/03-analyze-persons.Rmd", output_dir = "output")
rmarkdown::render("R/04-analyze-schools.Rmd", output_dir = "output")
rmarkdown::render("R/05-analyze-misc.Rmd", output_dir = "output")
```

# Highlights

Here are a couple of the coolest visualizations, in my opinion.
